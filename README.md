#Monte Carlo Markov Chain Graph Descent
Algorithms to find a local or global minumum on a graph. Constucts a Markov Chain walk on the graph and iterates until converging to minumum.

#Monte Carlo Integration
Basic Monte Carlo algorithm to evaluate discrete integrals by random sampling of values along the desired range. This is supported by the following convergence:
Given X\_1, X\_2, ... are i.i.d. Uniform[a,b], lim n-\>inf sum 1 to n f(i) /n = integral of f on a, b almost surely
