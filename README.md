#Monte Carlo Markov Chain Graph Descent
Algorithms to find a local or global minumum on a graph. Constucts a Markov Chain walk on the graph and iterates until converging to minumum.

#Monte Carlo Integration
Basic Monte Carlo algorithm to evaluate discrete integrals by random sampling of values along the desired range. This is supported by the following convergence:

#Monte Carlo Pi Estimation
This employs a popular method for the estimation of pi by simulating shooting darts at a square dartboard with a circle. Given random throws, the number of times the circle is hit should allow for an estimation of pi. The program produced the following plot:
